# Todo

Replace hardcoded material thickness / interlocking with setting

# Need to move some refresh to background or status updates
# Eg. update all scense / edit wall

## In Main Window 
Show status bar when loading a large file
Show updating status when ticking / unticking interlocking / texture
Handle checkboxes (different for if edit walls rather than view scene)
Make view scene honor checkboxes
When clicking edit but nothing selected give a warning - select object first


## In add wall window
Handle scale conversion to mm and vice versa
Warn and reset values when switching between custom and simplified
Warn and convert when switching between custom and simplified
Handle selection of scale
- when created set it to default
- when reset go back to default
Switching to custom set first entry to 0,0
Set Enter key to press OK


# Track updates 
Warn if open etc.
Also add "New" button

# Avoid overlap
When adding wall then prevent it from overlapping existing (by default)


# Copy wall
Prevent overlapping 
Possibly - rename copied walls (1) etc. instead of (copy)

# Edit wall 
Make it obvious in wall edit mode (not sure how best to achieve)
Force refresh on relevant scene when exiting edit wall
Ability to add / delete features 



# Future 
Show selected objects better
