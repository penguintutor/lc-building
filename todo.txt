# Todo

## In Main Window 
When clicking edit but nothing selected give a warning - select object first
Pressing delete should delete a wall (after confirmation)
When copy - perhaps ask new wall name?
Closing Windows needs to close all other windows

## In add / edit wall window
Warn and reset values when switching between custom and simplified
Warn and convert when switching between simplified and custom
Switching to custom set first entry to 0,0
Ensure profile menu is reset when adding new
After adding wall switch to that view
First move sometimes gets dropped (occasional bug)

# Track updates 
Warn if open etc.
Also add "New" button

# Avoid overlap
When adding wall then prevent it from overlapping existing (by default)

# Copy wall
Prevent overlapping  
Possibly - rename copied walls (1) etc. instead of (copy)

# Delete wall
Note need to update any interlockinggroups to refer to new wall references
Does not appear to delete all interlocking references

# Edit wall 
Make it obvious in wall edit mode - Possibly display mode / view in top left of graphicsView 
When choose align / position from right menu and no feature selected but is in position of menu then use that

# Add Feature
Show name instead of filename when adding feature
perhaps show icons?
Also apply filters based on type

# Textures
Handle removing texture

# Add Interlocking
No checking for duplicates
- Hide existing entries from add option
Can only delete and readd rather than edit
* If add edit then should not be allowed to change wall as that is where objects exist
Refresh doesn't work when deleting interlocking
Ensure that re-read walls for the add menu
Delete existing interlocking when opening file
Update display after changes

# Export
Show status whilst exporting

# Wall.py
Ensure that all updates that generate textures are in threads

# Track history - with undo and redo
Implement redo options based on saved history

# Feature Position Window
Allow two objects to be selected - first is treated as though it is the wall (does not move)
Assuming both feature and wall share some common methods (eg. get_maxwidth / get_maxheight) then should work the same

# Future 
Show selected objects better 
Perhaps texture picker
Texture allow zones within a wall
Helpers when doing interlocking (eg. whether forward vs reverse based on direction of edge) and perhaps suggested il for typical building / wizard.
