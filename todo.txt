# Todo

Update display when scale / interlocking changed
# For scale then do we need to do whenever update as may be through wallwindow?

# Need to move some refresh to background or status updates
# Eg. update all scenes / edit wall

## In Main Window 
When clicking edit but nothing selected give a warning - select object first
When quit chosen ask if save
Pressing delete should delete a wall (after confirmation)
When copy - perhaps ask new wall name?

## In add / edit wall window
Warn and reset values when switching between custom and simplified
Warn and convert when switching between simplified and custom
Switching to custom set first entry to 0,0
Ensure profile menu is reset when adding new
After adding wall switch to that view
First move sometimes gets dropped (occassional bug)

# Track updates 
Warn if open etc.
Also add "New" button

# Avoid overlap
When adding wall then prevent it from overlapping existing (by default)

# Copy wall
Prevent overlapping 
Possibly - rename copied walls (1) etc. instead of (copy)

# Delete wall
Note need to update any interlockinggroups to refer to new wall references
Does not appear to delete all interlocking references

# Edit wall 
Make it obvious in wall edit mode (not sure how best to achieve)
Force refresh on relevant scene when exiting edit wall
Update summary information when feature selected

# Add Feature
Show name instead of filename when adding feature
perhaps show icons?
Also apply filters based on type

# Textures
Possibly future plan
Update current edit display when adding / updating texture
Handle removing texture / perhaps set to "None"

# Add Interlocking
No checking for duplicates
- Hide existing entries from add option
Can only delete and readd rather than edit
* If add edit then should not be allowed to change wall as that is where objects exist
Refresh doesn't work when deleting interlocking
Ensure that re-read walls for the add menu
Delete existing interlocking when opening file

# Export
Show status whilst exporting

# Wall.py
Ensure that all updates that generate textures are in threads

# Track history - with undo and redo
Currently history is saved on objects - need to save in main windows / edit window instead

# Future 
Show selected objects better 
Perhaps texture picker 
Helpers when doing interlocking (eg. whether forward vs reverse based on direction of edge) and perhaps suggested il for typical building / wizard.
