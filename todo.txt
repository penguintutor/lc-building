# Todo

Replace hardcoded material thickness / interlocking with setting

# Need to move some refresh to background or status updates
# Eg. update all scenes / edit wall

## In Main Window 
Show updating status when ticking / unticking interlocking / texture
Handle checkboxes (different for if edit walls rather than view scene)
Make view scene honor checkboxes
When clicking edit but nothing selected give a warning - select object first
When quit chosen ask if save
Refresh (update_all_views) does not always appear to update all walls.
Pressing delete should delete a wall
When copy - perhaps ask new wall name?


## In add / edit wall window
Warn and reset values when switching between custom and simplified
Warn and convert when switching between simplified and custom
Handle selection of scale
- when created set it to default
- when reset go back to default
Switching to custom set first entry to 0,0
When returning from an edit - should return to the edit view
Ensure profile menu is reset when adding new
After adding wall switch to that view
After adding wall then texture is shown even if not ticked

# Track updates 
Warn if open etc.
Also add "New" button

# Avoid overlap
When adding wall then prevent it from overlapping existing (by default)


# Copy wall
Prevent overlapping 
Possibly - rename copied walls (1) etc. instead of (copy)

# Delete wall
Note need to update any interlockinggroups to refer to new wall references
Does not appear to delete all interlocking references

# Edit wall 
Make it obvious in wall edit mode (not sure how best to achieve)
Force refresh on relevant scene when exiting edit wall
Update summary information when feature selected


# Add Feature
Show name instead of filename when adding feature
perhaps show icons?
Also apply filters based on type


# Textures
Possibly future plan
Need to track if entire wall or whether to save polygon 
(ie. if not specified then entire wall and don't need to save points, but
if only specific area then do need to save - Not currently handled)
Update current edit display when adding / updating texture
Handle removing texture / perhaps set to "None"

# Add Interlocking
No checking for duplicates
- Hide existing entries from add option
Can only delete and readd rather than edit
* If add edit then should not be allowed to change wall as that is where objects exist
Refresh doesn't work when deleting interlocking
Ensure that re-read walls for the add menu
Delete existing interlocking when opening file


# Export
Show status whilst exporting


# Track history - with undo and redo
Currently history is saved on objects - need to save in main windows / edit window instead

# Future 
Show selected objects better 
Perhaps texture picker 
Helpers when doing interlocking (eg. whether forward vs reverse based on direction of edge) and perhaps suggested il for typical building / wizard.
