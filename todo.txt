# Todo

# Track updates 
Warn if open etc.
Also add "New" button

# Avoid overlap
When adding wall then prevent it from overlapping existing (by default)

# Copy wall
Prevent overlapping  
Possibly - rename copied walls (1) etc. instead of (copy)

# Delete wall
Note need to update any interlockinggroups to refer to new wall references
Does not appear to delete all interlocking references

# Edit wall 
Make it obvious in wall edit mode - Possibly display mode / view in top left of graphicsView 
When choose align / position from right menu and no feature selected but is in position of menu then use that

# Add Feature
Show name instead of filename when adding feature
perhaps show icons?
Also apply filters based on type

# Textures
Handle removing texture

# Add Interlocking
No checking for duplicates
- Hide existing entries from add option
Can only delete and readd rather than edit
* If add edit then should not be allowed to change wall as that is where objects exist
Refresh doesn't work when deleting interlocking
Ensure that re-read walls for the add menu
Delete existing interlocking when opening file
Update display after changes

# Export
Show status whilst exporting

# Wall.py
Ensure that all updates that generate textures are in threads

# Track history - with undo and redo
Implement redo options based on saved history

# Feature Position Window
Allow two objects to be selected - first is treated as though it is the wall (does not move)
Assuming both feature and wall share some common methods (eg. get_maxwidth / get_maxheight) then should work the same

# Future 
Show selected objects better 
Perhaps texture picker
Texture allow zones within a wall
Helpers when doing interlocking (eg. whether forward vs reverse based on direction of edge) and perhaps suggested il for typical building / wizard.
Allow multiple deletes (walls / features)
Is delete "Are you sure" still needed now we can undo?
